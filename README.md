# Reflection-Journal
This is a database to store up to 10 logs of daily reflections. Users have the option to describe their day with unrestricted text length, select an emotion descriptor, and apply a rating. The data will all be saved and can be retrieved between uses. Additionally, the data will be displayed in different charts, allowing for better interpretation by the user.
# Getting-Started
Once the files are downloaded, and using the VS Code Live Server Extension, navigate to the 'index.html' file. Press the 'Go Live' option at the bottom right of the screen.
